<body style="background-color:White;">

<p>Fast Food Restaurants have been around for a very long time, but the original Fast Food restaurant was founded by the company "White Castle" in 1921, and the second was founded by "A & W" in 1923.But some may say that "McDonald's", which opened in 1940 was the very first successful fast food business which still exists today..</p>
