    <h2 class="titlefstyle">Future of Food</h2>
    <p>According to Rob Polacek,Chief Creative Officer and Partner of Puccini Group, the future of fast food will revolve around suburban food halls, acorrding to his own designs along with statistics.  </p>
    <p>Over 359 fast-food restaurants have closed all over the US due to the competition of other restaurants, which is showing how the fast-food industry is slowly going out of business. And with all the empty fast-food restaurants, Polacek plans on repurposing the buildings to be food halls, where customers can buy, sell, and eat local food. Each food hall will serve food according to it's location, and serves much healthier food than what is normally sold.</p>
