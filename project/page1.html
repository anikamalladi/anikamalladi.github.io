    <h2 class="titlefstyle">Definition</h2>
    <p>Fast food is  mass produced food that is prepared and served very quickly. The food is typically less healthy compared to other foods and meals. While any meal with low preparation time can be considered fast food, typically the term refers to food sold in a restaurant that is premade, and served to the customer in a packaged form.</p>
    <p>Fast food restaurants are traditionally differentiated by their ability to serve food using a drive-through. Outlets may be stands or kiosks, which may provide no tables, or fast food restaurants.Restaurant chains may have standardized food shipped to each restaurant from central locations.</p>
